# 1. Copy paste and run the tribble given below.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(purrr)

tribble( ~x, ~y, ~w, ~z,
210, 300, 220, 180,
102, 100, 119, 187,
176, 175, 188, 173,
87, 95, 91, 94,
202, 210, 234, 218,
110, 122, 131, 128,
) -> dt
dt
```
## 1a. Use and show a map function to find the “mean” of each column of the dt data table
```{r}
means <- map_dbl(dt, mean)
round(means, 1)
```
## 1b. Use and show a map function to find the “standard deviation” of each column of the dt
```{r}
sd <- map_dbl(dt, sd)
round(sd, 1)
```
## 1c. Use and show a map function that will calculate the “square root” of each value of each column of the data table dt.
```{r}
sqrt <- dt %>% 
map(~sqrt(.))
sqrt
```

## 1d. Use R code to find the “mean”, “max”, “1st Quartile”, “3rd Quartile”, “Median”, and “Min” for each column of the dt data table. (Hint: You do not have to use a map function)
```{r}
summary(dt)
```
